# RoboSolis-Sensor-Sonar

In this example, the Robot Solis moves in a fenced space and bypasses the side walls and possible obstacles when detected by its sonar sensors at pre-configured distances.
The three sensors on the front are used to indicate obstacles and the sensors on the sides and rear assist in maneuvers and checks of the robot to avoid the detected obstacle
